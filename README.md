# Eurofurence Mobile Apps (Backend) 

- Backend is written in .NET Core an requires at least the Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.3 runtime.

- We use Swagger to document our API & data models.
  - You can us [SwaggerUI](https://app.eurofurence.org/swagger/v2/ui/) to interactively play with the backend in your browser.

- Our production backend is located at https://app.eurofurence.org/api/v2/ - it will return data (~3 months before of a convention usually fresh data, otherwise from last year) to test and design against.
  - You are free to consume the API from your own website/project/application! Please keep the request rates sane and feel free to share your work with us, we'd love to see!
